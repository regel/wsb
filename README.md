`wsb` is the the tool for downloading Yahoo! finance market data.

This go package aims to provide a reliable, threaded, and idiomatic way to download historical market data from Yahoo! Finance API and other finance data sources.

Although the Yahoo Finance API has officially been closed down, it does still work and it provides a free access to a vast number of stocks.

>Warning - The Yahoo Finance API could be removed or shut down at any point. You use this package at your own risk.

Other finance data sources supported in this package:

- [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/): IEX Cloud is a platform that makes financial data and services accessible to everyone. There is a free tier for use during initial API exploration and application development. During registration you will receive security tokens required to access this API
- [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/): CoinGecko provides a comprehensive cryptocurrency API. See Crypto Data API Plans on their web site for more information. At the time of this writting, the free plan is limited at 50 calls/minute (varies)

The following example show various way of configuring the same thing:

#### CLI

    wsb chart --tickers AAPL,GME --from "2021-01-01"

#### Environment Variables

    export WSB_TICKERS=AAPL,GME

    wsb chart --from "2021-01-01"

#### Config File

`config.yaml`:

```yaml
tickers:
  - AAPL
  - GME
```

#### Config Usage

    wsb chart --config config.yaml --from "2021-01-01"


`wsb` supports any format [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) can read, i. e. JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, and Java properties files.

Notice that if no config file is specified, then `wsb.yaml` (or any of the supported formats) is loaded from the current directory, `$HOME/.wsb`, or `/etc/wsb`, in that order, if found.

## Building from Source

`wsb` is built using Go 1.13 or higher.

It uses [Goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) under the covers.

To build:

```
goreleaser build --rm-dist --snapshot
```

### Known issues

On MacOS the `boring` build fails. Comment the lines in `.goreleaser.yml` to disable this build.

```
runtime/cgo(__TEXT/__text): relocation target x_cgo_inittls not defined
```
